            <p class="presentation__content__text">I am a front-end developer with over 2 years of experience. I started my programming journey in 2018 when I took a Python course on YouTube's Curso em VÃ­deo. Quickly, I began applying my knowledge to solve mathematical problems and decided that the technology field would be my career.</p>
            <p class="presentation__content__text">Currently, I work as a front-end development intern at Nexti, where I work with ReactJS, TypeScript, and JavaScript. Previously, I worked as an IT intern at an accounting firm, where I developed monitoring systems and task management. In addition, I have knowledge in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, MySQL, hardware, and networks. I have a passion for technology and am always seeking improvement and learning new languages and frameworks. My main skills are focused on front-end, where I can create modern and interactive interfaces that provide a great user experience.</p>
